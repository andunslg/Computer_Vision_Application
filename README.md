Computer_Vision_Application
===========================
This is a project done for my undergraduate studies. This is a simple image processign application which is capble of,

1.       Loading an image (JPEG, PNG and BMP formats)

2.       Saving an image (JPEG, BMP and PNG formats)

3.       Applying Noise filters (mean, median, min-max and alpha trimmed mean filter with mask sizes ranging from 3x3 to 10x10)

4.       Do Edge detections (sobel, prewitt, roberts and canny)

5.       Creating Image histogram

6.       Do Comparison of two images (having same dimensions) and compute the difference image between them
